This is java opengl engine experiment number: iDontKnowAnymore.xx.x

This code is based on the 3D engine I used for my bachelor thesis, 
which is based on the GitBook "3D Game Development with LWJGL 3" from Antonio Hern√°ndez Bejarano's (see links below).
From there it has developed to the current state and serves a playground.
