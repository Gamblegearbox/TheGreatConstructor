This is java opengl engine experiment number: iDontKnowAnymore.1

The 3D engine from my bachelor thesis was mainly based on Antonio Hern√°ndez Bejarano's GitBook "3D Game Development with LWJGL 3".

Repository: https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook

Book: https://www.gitbook.com/book/lwjglgamedev/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/details

This is, so to say, the next iteration with the goal to use it as a game jam engine. It will still follow most of the book's concepts and a lot of code will be based on Antonio's code.
